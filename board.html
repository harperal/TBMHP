              <h3>Board Member</h3><br>
              <p>
                Sandra Galli lives in Elkton, Oregon. Elkton is a small, historic town, overlooking the beautiful Umpqua River and nestled in 
                Oregon’s coastal mountains. Here Sandra enjoys a simple life where she is a city council member, works at a vineyard in the 
                tasting room, is a for hire as a professional gardener, and a first-year beekeeper. Sandra walks regularly along the side of 
                the Umpqua River with a group of ladies and her German Shepherd. This is where she met Lori Batterman.
                <br>
                <br>
                Sandra has never met Tom Batterman, but has heard his life story through Lori Batterman. Lori found Tom to be “very intelligent, 
                honest, athletic, and unique.” When Lori asked Sandra to join the Tom Batterman Mental Health Project, she accepted the position 
                immediately. When Sandra was born, her father suffered a nervous breakdown and later was diagnosed with manic depressive disorder. 
                She knows first-hand how debilitating mental health illnesses are. Sandra is committed to supporting the TBMHP.
